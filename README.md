![Architecture Diagram](/public/screenshots/architecture-diagram.png)

### Core Components

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Next.js App Router for page routing
   - React components for UI
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Client-side state management

2. **API Layer**
   - RESTful API endpoints via Next.js API Routes
   - Real-time communication

3. **AI Layer**
   - Sensay API integration for AI capabilities
   - Custom prompt engineering
   - Context management for personalized experiences

4. **Data Layer**
   - PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
   - Redis caching for performance
   - AWS S3 for file storage

5. **Authentication Layer**
   - Privy authentication service
   - User management and profiles

### Data Flow

1. User requests are handled by Next.js routing
2. API routes process requests and communicate with Sensay API
3. Sensay API generates AI responses based on user context
4. Data is stored and retrieved from the database via Prisma
5. Responses are sent back to the client for rendering

## üö¶ Getting Started
